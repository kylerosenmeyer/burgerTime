# burgerTime
Coding Bootcamp HW14 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**burgerTime** is a full stack food app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. The app allows the user to devour items on the burger menu, and add/edit and remove burgers from the menu.

This app is useful to learn the principals of tying a full stack together. burgerTime uses Mysql, Express, Handlebars and Node.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
